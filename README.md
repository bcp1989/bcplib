bcplib
======
bcplib is a c library of common data structures and algorithms. Not like 
glib, the main design of bcplib is to make all data structures independent, 
which means user only need to include normally 1 or 2 non-system header 
files to use a specific data structure or algorithm.
Currently, bcplib is developed on gcc-4.
