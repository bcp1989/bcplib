        <h1>bcplib</h1>

<p>bcplib is a object-oriented C library of common data structures and algorithms. 
The philosophy of bcplib is to build a easy-to-use, easy-to-extend library.
And I also try to make all modules independent so that user may only need
a very limit subset of bcplib to run a specific module. The development of
bcplib is motivated by Java SDK. If you are familiar with Java, you can use
bcplib in a way that you use Java.</p>

<p>Currently, bcplib is developed and tested in gcc 4. When using bcplib, you need
to make sure the structure alignment strategy in specific Compiler won't 
influence the function of bcplib.</p>

<p>Be ware of the number of objects you created. Object in bcplib is space
consuming, in a 32-bit architecture, a <em>arraylist</em> object takes up to 104 bytes.</p>

<hr><h1>How to use bcplib</h1>

<p>The interface of bcplib is very simple.</p>

<h2>Create &amp;&amp; destroy Object</h2>

<p><code>class_name A = create(class_name);</code> for "new" a Object and 
<code>destory(class_instance);</code> for "release" a Object.</p>

<p>For constructors with arguments, there are a set of <code>create</code> functions named as
<code>createN();</code> where <em>N</em> is the number of arguments. Currently, only zero to three
arguments are supported. For example, 
<code>class_name a = create1(class_name, argument1_name, argument1_value);</code>
will call the specific initialization function with 1 argument.</p>

<h2>Function call</h2>

<p>If a class is named A, and there is a instance of A called a, you can use 
<code>a-&gt;function_name(a, other_arguments);</code> to make a function call, remember to 
put the instance itself as the first argument of any function call, it's a
naive way to simulate <em>this</em> reference in Java.</p>

<h2>Cast</h2>

<p>Just like Java. If class A extends/inherits class B, you can use a instance 
of A where you need a instance of B. You can directly cast A to B. </p>

<p>For example, you can have a array of instance of class <em>collection</em>, and each 
instance may be a <em>arraylist</em>, <em>linkedlist</em> or other class that inherits/extends
from <em>collection</em>.</p>

<p>There are two ways to cast a object from one class to another. You can just type
either <code>(class_A_name) class_B_instance_var</code> or 
<code>cast(class_A_name, class_B_instance_var)</code>
to cast a instance variable of class B to class A. The different is that the
later one will do the type check.</p>

<h2>Class Type</h2>

<p>Every object has a class type structure to indicate the type of the object.
To check if a object is exactly the instance of a class, use
<code>instanceof</code>. To check if a object inherits/extends or is a instance of a class,
use <code>kindof</code>.</p>

<h2>Conventions for developing bcplib</h2>

<ol>
<li>The construction and deconstruction function should be named as
<code>class_name_create();</code> and <code>class_name_destroy(id obj);</code>, for constructors
with arguments, the name should be
<code>class_name_create_by_arg1_name_arg2_name(arg1, arg2);</code>
</li>
<li>There should be a class_name_prototype macro used to be inherited. For a 
example of the macro, please see &lt;bcplib/container/arraylist.h&gt;</li>
<li>Structure name should not be the same with the class name.</li>
<li>Call <code>DEFINE_CLASS</code> at header file, and call <code>INIT_CLASS</code> in the source file.
Please see any class inside bcplib for more detail.</li>
</ol><h1>OO in bcplib</h1>

<p>Like Java, bcplib support concepts of class, single inherit/extends, interface, 
abstract class, final class. However, some of the concepts are not 100% the same 
as Java. Especially, the concept <em>inherit</em> and <em>extend</em> in bcplib are different.</p>

<h2>Things to know before start</h2>

<p>The internal represent of bcplib may be complicated, however, to provide a easy-
to-use library, the interface of bcplib is very simple, even, a little bit 
incompatible with the "normal" rule of software development. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>id</em>, a universal pointers to <em>Object</em> in bcplib, just like <em>id</em> in 
Objective-C. Nearly every <em>Object Function</em> takes a <em>id</em> as input, to simulate
the <em>this</em> reference. Inside each <em>Object Function</em>, the function first cast 
the <em>id</em> to the type it needs so that user don`t have to do the cast when use
a function of parent class. </li>
<li>Every class type is a pointer type. For example, "arraylist" is actually
"arraylist_t *". You can also use your own way to allocate the structure and
use initialize a class instead of create function. For example, normally, you
write <code>arraylist a = arraylist_create();</code>, here <em>a</em> is a pointer type; and you
can also write <code>arraylist_t a;</code> and then use <code>arraylist_init(&amp;a);</code> to
initialize it, here <em>a</em> is a structure type.</li>
</ul><h2>Class</h2>

<p>In bcplib, each class is actually a structure. Every class in bcplib <em>extends</em> 
the root class <em>Object</em>. We need the following things to define a class:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <em>prototype</em> of class, defined by using a macro.</li>
<li>Definition for each function type.</li>
<li>Functions to <em>create</em> and <em>destroy</em> a class.</li>
<li>Functions to <em>initialize</em> and <em>finalize</em> a class.</li>
</ul><h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>In order to let others inherits/extends itself, one <em>Class</em> should define a 
prototype of itself. The prototype is defined by using a macro, simply list all 
data and functions.</p>

<h2>Inherit</h2>

<p>In bcplib, inherit is just use another set of functions to initialize a class.
If class A inherits class B, A cannot have any function or data that B does not 
have. For example, function <em>arraylist_create_list_iterator</em> in <em>arraylist.c</em> 
create a anonymous class that inherits class <em>list_iterator</em> by initializing the
class with some functions defined in <em>arraylist.c</em>.</p>

<h2>Extends</h2>

<p>Extends in bcplib is like Java. Class A extends class B means that A has all
function declarations and data that B has, and A may has its own functions or 
data that B does not have. In the prototype of A, the prototype of B should be 
the first element so that we can cast A to B. However, this trick way is 
depend on the structure alignment strategy in specific Compiler.</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Interface is just a macro contains data or function lists. A class may includes
the interface in any position of its prototype except the first one (first 
element is reserved for the prototype of parent class). We cannot cast a class
to the interface it implements. So the concept interface in bcplib is 
incomplete compared to Java.</p>

<h2>Abstract class</h2>

<p>You cannot create a abstract class, so in bcplib, a class without any <em>create</em> 
or "destroy" functions can be treated as a abstract class. User can still 
allocate a abstract class and use "init_xxxx" function to initialize it, but 
it's very dangerous, for the definition of such a abstract class may be 
incomplete, any function call may lead unknown error.</p>

<h2>Final class</h2>

<p>You cannot extends/inherits a final class in bcplib, since final class does not 
have a prototype as well as <em>initialize</em> and <em>finalize</em> functions.</p>
